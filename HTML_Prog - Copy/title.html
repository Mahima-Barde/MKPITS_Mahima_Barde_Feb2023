<p> Libraries have a significant role in society. Besides collecting information particularly regarding the history and culture of society, good libraries in a city also provide readers with free opportunities for learning through newspapers, magazines, books and multimedia tools. Public libraries in a place are the first place where a child may delve into a book.

Good libraries in a place, therefore, play vital role in the overall development of the locals. It is a good option for book lovers who cannot afford the high prices of books, as they can read books free from these libraries. Nagpur possesses plenty of well-established libraries that encourage the reading habits of residents of Nagpur.
